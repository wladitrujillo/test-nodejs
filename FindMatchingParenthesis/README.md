Implement String prototype method findParenMatch, taking an index pointing into the string as an argument:
String.prototype.findParenMatch = function(pos) {} ;

Based on the given index, return the index of the matching parenthesis in the given string; or -1, Nothing or a similar empty value, if there is no such index.

What is the matching parenthesis?
Consider this string: "(())". The two outer parentheses are a set, and the two inner ones are another set.

   set 1
  ________
 |        |
 V        V
 (  (  )  )
    ^  ^
    |__|
    set 2

Examples:

```
"(something)".findParenMatch(0) => 10 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 0 is at index 10.
"(something)".findParenMatch(10) => 0 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 10 is at index 0.
```

```
"(som(th)ng)".findParenMatch(0)  => 10 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 0 is at index 10.
"(som(th)ng)".findParenMatch(10) =>  0 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 10 is at index 0.
"(som(th)ng)".findParenMatch(4)  =>  7 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 4 is at index 7.
"(som(th)ng)".findParenMatch(7)  =>  4 // because the parenthesis that matches the one on index 7 is at index 4.

```

```
")()".findParenMatch(0) => -1 // because there is no matching parenthesis in the string
")()".findParenMatch(1) =>  2 // as usual.

"())".findParenMatch(0) =>  1 // since it's the closest match
"())".findParenMatch(1) =>  0 // as usual.
"())".findParenMatch(2) => -1 // because it's already closed by the parenthesis at index 1.

```


Input Assumptions
The index pos/n provided will always be within the range of the string.

The only characters occurring in the string are a-z and () - you do not need to account for other types of brackets such as [] or {}.
